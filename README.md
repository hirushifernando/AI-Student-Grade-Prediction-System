This project predicts student grades using Machine Learning models trained on feature datasets.  
It demonstrates data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using Python and Jupyter Notebook.

## Features
- ML model for predicting student grades
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Model evaluation using ROC-AUC
- Jupyter Notebook for detailed analysis

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
